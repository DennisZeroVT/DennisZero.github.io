    <h2>My Story</h2>

    <p>
      My name is <b>Dennis van Wijngaarden</b>, and I have always had a passion for video games and music. I started creating video games many years ago, and during that time I discovered how much I enjoyed making music. That moment pushed me toward becoming a music producer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the years, I tried many different DAWs. I started with FL Studio, then moved on to Cubase and Studio One. Each one helped me learn more about producing and finding my own style.
    </p>

      <h3>My Catalyst Vivid</h3>
      <p>
        In 2025, I tried joining Discord communities again for the first time in many years. I slowly started interacting with people, and in my very first server I met someone named VividExile. Even though I often felt alone in that server, I somehow felt connected to him. He seemed troubled by his life, since he is an ex‑military veteran, but he still showed a lot of strength and kindness.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we talked more, I noticed his health and energy were often low, and I tried my best to support him. At the same time, he supported me too. We helped each other through a lot, and that connection meant more than I expected. Looking back, I think the server owner probably hurt his feelings as well, not just mine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though the owner of that first server ended up hurting me, meeting Vivid proved that I could keep going and do more than I thought. He was also the reason I became a streamer again, and through him I met many new people, including Erik.

      <h3>Meeting Erik and My First Song</h3>
      <p>
        When the first server owner turned out to be a bad person, I followed Vivid to a Discord server run by a VTuber. After a few weeks in that community, I came across someone named Erik. I first noticed him because of a Twitter post where he made the Devourer of Gods his pet, and I thought it was really funny. I've always loved Terraria, so it immediately caught my attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I started interacting with him, we slowly began collaborating, playing together, as he became my friend. Around that time, I mentioned that I wanted to make a song again, and that I didn't mind making one for free. Erik told me he would love to have a song, and that simple moment was what started everything. Over time, our connection made the idea of creating music feel exciting again.
      </p>
      <p>
        That led to the creation of my first released song. In 2025, I published it on music platforms like Spotify. The track was called <i>Snowfall</i>, and it was made for Erik, also known as eri_k416. The song was written about his character Viona, and it was also the first time I ever wrote lyrics for a song. Because of that, <i>Snowfall</i> became a very special and meaningful project for me.
